# Sowing Success: How Machine Learning Helps Farmers Select the Best Crops

## Problem Statement

Farmers need to select the most suitable crop for their fields to ensure optimal growth and maximum yield. However, measuring soil metrics like nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value can be costly and time-consuming. This project seeks to leverage machine learning to predict the best crop based on soil measurements, helping farmers make informed decisions efficiently.

## Dataset

The dataset provided, `soil_measures.csv`, contains the following columns:

- **N**: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- **P**: Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
- **K**: Potassium content ratio in the soil
- **pH**: pH value of the soil
- **crop**: Categorical values representing various crops (target variable)

Each row represents soil measurements for a specific field, with the corresponding optimal crop specified in the "crop" column.

## Approach

This project will follow these key steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, identify any missing values or outliers, and gain insights into the distribution of soil metrics and crop types.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the dataset and preprocess the data to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms. Techniques to address multicollinearity will be employed to enhance model performance.

3. **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms suitable for multi-class classification tasks. Evaluate and compare their performance using appropriate metrics.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the selected model on the dataset, fine-tuning hyperparameters as needed. Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

5. **Prediction and Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to predict the optimal crop for new soil measurements. Provide recommendations to farmers based on model predictions.
